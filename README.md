# Site Diary App

With this project we'll be focusing on the development of a platform to support the Electronic Site Diary.
This platform must be used to replace the traditional Site Diary (on paper), in which all the relevant
facts relating to the execution of licensed or authorized constructions, in order to provide information about
the development of the construction, which elucidates all those involved in the process of
execution of the construction, especially supervisors like municipal employees.
